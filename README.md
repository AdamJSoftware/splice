## Overview

I decided to limit the scope of this project. Especially in terms of styling. I could have spent another few hours and added a bunch of theming, colours etc... However, I decided to focus more on the technical side of things. This is why I also decided to not use an existing UI library or styling library. I decided to code most of my components from scratch and apply my own themes using scss. I wanted to demonstrate my technical abilities in frontend development. If I was to use existing libraries, I would have choosen Mantine or Tailwind. The styling is rather simple however it does have proper responsiveness built in allowing for the use with any screen and some nice animations. I used react-query for fetching the data as it is a standard in the react ecosystem. I also added some path aliases as well to help keep the code clean. If you have any questions or concerns. Please do not hesistate to contact me.
